## I want to submit or request a talk!

Awesome! :tada: Go check out the [issues page][] and submit your proposal
or request there!

## I want information about the current/next meetup!

Check out the [RORO Meetup page][] for all the latest info!

## I want information about past meetups!

Information is a bit dispersed, but you can:

- Check the contents of this repo under the appropriate dated directory<br />
  (eg `2017/09` contains information about the September 2017 meetup)
- Check out the [wiki page][]
- Check the [Meetup page][RORO Meetup page] and run a search for the meetup
  you're looking for.

## I want to see the pretty meetup slide decks!

Feel free to clone this repo! Depending on the slide deck (see the `README`
file in the dated meetup directory for details), the markdown in the slide
decks can be used and viewed in either:

- [Deckset][]
- [GitPitch][]

```sh
git clone git@github.com:rails-oceania/roro.git
cd roro
```
