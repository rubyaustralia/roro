  this meetup to provide a friendly and welcoming environment for everyone who
  attends, and harassment of any kind is not tolerated.
- If you have any issues you want to raise about anything that has happened at
  a RORO, you can talk to any of the organisers who are Paul and Rob, or you can
  go straight to a Ruby Australia committee member if you don't think you can
  reach out to a RORO organiser.

@css[f29 capitalize light-pink uppercase work-sans](Speakers! @fa[bullhorn])
@snapend

Note:
- We are looking for speakers!
- We want *you* to present something at RORO because presenting at RORO is a
  win/win situation.
- You, the speaker, practice a skill and learn new things, and we, the audience,
  leverage your knowledge to learn new things that can potentially help us.
- It's great public speaking practice in front of an audience that wants you to
  succeed because we're all here to learn cool new things, and...
- Any talk you present here is great fodder for your resume and portfolio, and
  just by virtue of presenting, everyone will think you're an expert, which will
  surely lead to at least an endorsement on LinkedIn
- So if you've got something to say, or to show and tell, that you think the
  Ruby community would love to hear about...

  wanting to do more.
- Also, if you need any help creating or critiquing your presentation or want
  someone to do a dry run, then please feel free to approach any of the RORO
  organisers and we're happy to help you in any way we can to make you look
  awesome up on stage.
